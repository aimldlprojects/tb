## Steps to run the reat native app using vscode, andriod studio and react native

* Create a sample react native project in vscode
  * npx @react-native-community/cli init `<<ProjectName>>`
* Open build.gradle file that is generated by vscode in android studio
  * Let Android Studio sync your project with Gradle.
  * Select a device (emulator or physical device) and click the "Run" button in Android Studio.
* Hot reload the code changes in UI
  * Keep the Metro Bundler running in vs code using npm start or npx react-native start
  * This reflect the code changes in app ui

## Install Java

* Download the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)) or AdoptOpenJDK ([https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://adoptopenjdk.net/)).
* Set the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable:
  * **Locate your Java installation directory:**
    * **Windows:** Typically located in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version>`.
  * Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable:
    * **Windows:**
      * **Right-click "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties".**
      * **Click on "Advanced syste**m settings".
      * **Click on the "Environment Variables" button.**
      * **Under "System variables", click "New".**
      * **Enter "JAVA_HOME"^^ as the variable name.**
      * **Enter the path to your Java installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19`) as the variable value.**
      * **Click "OK" to save the changes.**
      * **Open a new command prompt or terminal window for the changes to take effec**
  * Verify JAVA_HOME:
    * Open a new command prompt or terminal.
    * Type `echo $JAVA_HOME` and press Enter.
      * You should see the path to your Java installation directory printed in the console.
  * Verify the Java Version:
    * java -version
  * Try Running the React Native Command :
    * **Run the command:** `npx react-native run-android`

## Creat new react project

* npx @react-native-community/cli init `<<ProjectName>>`

## Start react project

* npx react-native start

## Run project on Emulator

* npx react-native run-android

## Run project on Physical Device

* Enable developer options and USB debugging on your device.
* Connect your device to your computer via USB.
* Run the command: `npx react-native run-android`

## Project Files

MyProjectName/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js /.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ LandingScreen.js
â”œâ”€â”€ ... other project files ...

* Create App.js
* Create components directory
  * Create LandingScreen.js file inside components directory
* Copy the components logic like landing page in to LandingScreen.js
* Call the LandingScreen.js in App.js and run the application

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the `<kbd>`R`</kbd>` key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (`<kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd>` + `<kbd>`M`</kbd>` (on Window and Linux) or `<kbd>`Cmd âŒ˜`</kbd>` + `<kbd>`M`</kbd>` (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit `<kbd>`Cmd âŒ˜`</kbd>` + `<kbd>`R`</kbd>` in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
